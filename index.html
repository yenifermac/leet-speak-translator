              1f y0u c4n r34d 7h15 y0u r34lly n33d 70 637 4 l1f3! (If you can read this you really need to get a life!) Well... Thank you... I guess? If you're like me, chances are you had no problem reading that sentence. I'm sure you'd agree it's a slightly insulting sentence to say the least. But the truth is most people struggle to understand what it's all about, if they're able to understand it at all.
              That’s why I thought it might be helpful to create this l33t sp34k ch34t sh33t (or leet speak cheat sheet!) that’ll help you cheat your way from n00b to l33t in no time.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <div class="history-description">
              <p>
                Almost a decade before Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web saw its first light of day back in 1991, 
                leet speak was born. Back then when the internet was coming up,
                most search functionalities simply looked for keywords in text to show relevant documents. 
                Hackers weren't very keen on having their information displayed on websites, bulletin boards,
                newsgroups or any other place, so they started to replace certain letters in words. 
                It started out with simple vowel substitutions like a 4 instead of an A, or a 3 instead of an E.
                This meant that topics like cracking or hacking remained undetected.
                <br>
                <br>
                One other (conspiracy) theory is that leet speak was invented as a way to beat automatic government surveillance programs,
                such as the legendary Echelon program.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br>
                In that period leet speak existed only in small circles, and was only used when necessary.
                It originated within bulletin boards, where someone having an ""elite"" status meant he or she was allowed access to file folders, games and chat rooms. 
                But it wasn't until the addition of internet connectivity to one of the most influential titles in the video games industry,
                Doom and Doom II that the use of leet speak exploded.
                <br><br>
                From there on leet speak evolved from a method to mislead search functionalities into a language for online gamers to describe formidable prowess or accomplishment.
                Phrases such as "1 4m 3l33t!" (I am elite!) were thrown around to demonstrate someone was an experienced gamer (or hacker).

            <p>
              To put any of the above in perspective, you can use the Leet Speak Translator below to turn any text you'd like into Leet. This translator converts normal words or text into leet speak. You can even select any of the four levels. The Leet Speak Translator makes it easier to actually talk in leet to others,
               since you only have to copy and paste text. So go on, get your 1337 on, and start converting!
